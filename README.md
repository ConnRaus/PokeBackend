# PokeBackend

A WIP pocket monster battle simulator in the command line based on the generation 5 Pok√©mon games.

C++ project to get more familiar with organizing larger-scale object oriented personal projects.

Currently working on getting Moves implemented, they're the final step before being able to test a stripped-down battle system.

Mons are mostly finished, they're able to be created with their base stats/IVs/Moves and stored in a library.

Types are also implemented, type effectiveness calculations work.

Battling will be implemented after a few moves are finished. 

Items/Natures to be added later on down the line.

Use `cmake .` to generate a Makefile, then `make` to compile the project.

`main` gets put in the `bin` folder, run it with `./bin/main` to start the program.
